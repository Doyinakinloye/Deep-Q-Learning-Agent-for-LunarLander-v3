# Deep-Q-Learning-Agent-for-LunarLander-v3

Welcome to my first complete Deep Q-Learning project! This repository showcases a reinforcement learning agent trained to solve the LunarLander-v3 environment using PyTorch and Gymnasium. It represents a major milestone in my journey into AI and reinforcement learning.

🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build an intelligent agent capable of learning to land a spacecraft safely on the lunar surface. Using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, the agent learns optimal actions through trial and error, guided by rewards and penalties.

Key achievements:

✅ Solved the environment in 555 episodes with an average score of 200.66

✅ Implemented experience replay, ε-greedy exploration, and soft target updates

✅ Built and trained a custom neural network architecture from scratch

🧠 What I Learned
This project pushed me to understand and implement:

✔ The mechanics of Q-learning and the Bellman equation

✔ How to stabilize training using target networks and soft updates

✔ The importance of experience replay for breaking correlation in training data

✔ How to balance exploration vs. exploitation using an ε-greedy policy

✔ The full training loop, from environment setup to model saving and evaluation

🛠️ Technologies Used:

✔ Python

✔ PyTorch

✔ Gymnasium (LunarLander-v3)

💼 Why This Matters (For Recruiters)

This project reflects my ability to:

✅ Learn independently and apply complex concepts from scratch

✅ Build scalable AI systems using industry-standard tools

✅ Debug and optimize deep learning models in real-world environments

✅ Communicate technical work clearly and effectively

✅ NumPy

✅ Google Colab
